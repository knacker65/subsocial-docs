## What is Subsocial?
Subsocial is a set of Substrate pallets with a Web UI that allows anyone to launch their own decentralized social network or community. 
Subsocial is **not** a decentralized social network, like Twitter or Facebook, but rather Subsocial is a platform for building social networks.

## Where does the name come from?
Subsocial will be the underlying architecture which the social networks of the future are built on top of. The prefix Sub refers to two things:
 - Subsocial will be the base layer supporting all of the social networks built on top of it
 - Subsocial is built on the Substrate technology

## Is Subsocial a parachain, or a standalone chain?
Both. The Subsocial betanet is transitioning to a standalone chain named Subsocial, while we are launching a parachain named SubsocialX 
(the X represents the experimental, exploratory, and cross-chain nature of the project).

SubsocialX will be used more for Social Finance and cross-project integrations, 
as mentioned [here](https://app.subsocial.network/@subsocial/why-is-subsocial-bidding-for-a-parachain-slot-22225), 
while the main Subsocial chain will be used for social networking. A bridge between the two will be created, and the same token will be used for both chains.

## Why does Subsocial need a parachain?
To learn about why Subsocial is launching as a parachain, please read 
[this article](https://app.subsocial.network/@subsocial/why-is-subsocial-bidding-for-a-parachain-slot-22225).

## How does Subsocial compare to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.?
Because Subsocial is not a social network, but a platform to build social networks on, this is an apples to oranges comparison.
However, social networks built on top of Subsocial will have numerous advantages compared to Web2 social networks,
such as decentralization, censorship resistance, multiple avenues of decentralized monetization (no middle-men to take a cut), 
and various other benefits of running on a blockchain.

## What are the benefits of building a community on Subsocial?
Due to some of the features listed above, Subsocial will allow you to create a much more vibrant and involved community. 
Utilizing social tokens and decentralized governance features, community members will be able to become participants in a way never before experienced.
Because Subsocial is a censorship resistant protocol, there is no central authority that can control your community. Instead, the community itself
can determine their own moderation and membership rules.

## How can users benefit from using Subsocial?
On traditional social networks, most users never receive any compensation for the value they provide to the network. 
With social networks built on Subsocial, users will actually be able to capture the value they produce through various monetization methods,
like tipping, subscriptions, social tokens, selling ad space, and more. Additionally, Subsocial will feature an algorithm marketplace, 
letting users be in control of the content they see.

## I am having trouble figuring out how to use Subsocial. What can I do?
Subsocial is still in its beta phase, and we are working on improving the user interface and experience.
If you have any questions, please reach out to us in our [Telegram](http://t.me/Subsocial) or [Discord](http://discord.gg/w2Rqy2M) chats.

## How is inappropriate or illegal content handled on Subsocial?

Subsocial has two ways to handle undesirable content. All posts must be made in spaces, 
and the owner(s) of a space can either moderate themselves, or appoint moderators, who can take care of stuff like that. 
Additionally, because Subsocial is made up of a separate back-end (the blockchain) and front-end (websites or mobile apps), 
the creators/operators of the front-end can moderate on their end. Here is an easy example: a website that runs on Subsocial that is just dedicated to cats 
would not show any content from the Subsocial blockchain that has to do with dogs.

## Will there be an IDO?

An IDO is not planned at this time.

## Will there be an IEO?

The team is currently looking into an IEO, but nothing has been announced yet. Follow our [announcements channel](https://t.me/SubsocialNetwork) to stay updated.

## Is there a way to get free tokens in order to use Subsocial?

You can get a free token from our [token faucet](https://app.subsocial.network/faucet) by filling out a short survey.

## How can I buy Subsocial tokens?

Currently it is not possible to buy Subsocial tokens.

## What is the name of Subsocial’s token?

The name of the token is **SUB**.

## What is the total token supply?

The total supply is 100m tokens.

## Can I stake my tokens that are still locked in vesting?

Yes, you can stake tokens that have not vested yet.

## Is SUB an ERC20 token?

**No**. Subsocial has its own native token built on the Substrate blockchain framework. Our token uses the same technology as DOT, KSM, KAR, and other tokens of Substrate-based chains.

## Where can I see Subsocial's smart contracts?

There are no smart contracts for Subsocial, because it is built as a custom blockchain on top of the [Substrate](https://substrate.dev/) blockchain framework. The Subsocial blockchain is optimized for social networking types of operations, and has very low fees.

## Do you have a lightpaper?

[Subsocial Lightpaper](/docs/lightpaper)

## Where can I learn about Subsocial's tokenomics?

[Subsocial Tokenomics](/docs/tokenomics/economics-vs-distribution)

## How do I start using Subsocial?

Install the **Polkadot.js** extension in your browser. This extension allows you to sign transactions for the Subsocial blockchain. It’s similar to MetaMask (a browser extension for Ethereum).

- On Chrome, install via [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/polkadot%7Bjs%7D-extension/mopnmbcafieddcagagdcbnhejhlodfdd)
- On Firefox, install via [Firefox add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/polkadot-js-extension/)

After the Polkadot extension is installed, create (or import) your account and then you can sign in on the Subsocial web dapp (decentralized application) by visiting this [link](https://app.subsocial.network). To use the dapp, you will need Subsocial tokens, so please visit our [token faucet](https://app.subsocial.network/faucet).

## Can I use Subsocial on mobile devices?

You can read posts and comments on mobile devices. Currently it is not possible to post, 
comment, up/downvote, share, or follow from mobile devices. This is because our current web dapp requires the Polkadot.js extension to sign transactions, and modern mobile browsers (like Chrome and Firefox) do not support the extension. We currently have a mobile app in development.

## Is there an existential deposit on Subsocial?

Currently the existential deposit on the betanet is 0.1 SUB. This is subject to change in the future depending on the overall tokenomics of Subsocial.

## I have problems with the Polkadot{.js} extension. What should I do?

### My account is not displaying correctly

Double check that your extension is connected to the web dapp. If so, [refreshing the page](/docs/faq/overview#i-reloaded-a-page-but-it-did-not-help) helps.

### I do not see new accounts from Polkadot.js extension

If you don’t see new Polkadot{.js} accounts on the web dapp in the top right corner, try to sign out, [reload the page](/docs/faq/overview#i-reloaded-a-page-but-it-did-not-help), and sign back in.

### I reloaded a page, but it did not help

We recommend reloading the page with cache clean (Ctrl+F5 in most browsers).

### My transactions fail

In most cases, reloading a page of the Subsocial web dapp should solve your problem. If you are still having trouble with sending transactions (when following a space, creating a post or a comment, upvoting, etc.), report it to one of our [official chats](/docs/faq/overview#what-are-the-official-social-links) (preferably main chat in English).
